<strong>Output</strong> of the above element: <em>Markup</em>  -- this is the output.<br>
<strong>Break</strong>:<br>
  Mary had a little toad<br>
  Its skin as tough as shell<br>
  And every file that toad would write<br>
  It used HTML.<br>
<strong>Paragraohs</strong>:<br>
  The following is an example of paragraph <br>
<p>This paragraph is typed using <textarea><p>enter your paragraph here</p></textarea> tags</p>

      <p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>
      <h2>The Web</h2>
        <p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>
      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for <em>ypertext Markup Language</em>. It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p>
      <h4>Elements Practice:</h4>

      <p><strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluoride</em></p>
      <p><strong>Molecular formula:</strong> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub></p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher density than air. Basically the opposite of helium. <mark>Crazy!</mark></p>
    <h4>Div:</h4>
      <div>
        Call me Ishmael.
        <br><br>
        Just don't call me late for dinner.

        <p>Call me Ishmael.</p>
        <p>Just don't call me late for dinner.</p>
      </div>
</div>
<h4>Lists:</h4>
  <h5>Ordered List:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>block elements</li>
      <li>inline elements</li>
    </ol>
  <h5>Unordered List:</h5>
    <h5>Block Elements:</h5>
      <ul>

    <h5>optional closing tags:</h5>
      <p>p(paragraph) tag and li(Listed items) tag are the two tags which produces the same output with or without its closing tag </p>

<!--Sometimes when you're working on a Web page, you don't know what images you're going to use,
but you still want a picture to use as a place holder.
Websites like placebear.com and placekitten.com are designed to make this super easy.
All you have to do to get an image of any given size is put the width and height of the image at the end of the URL,
as in https://placebear.com/200/300.
you can find other similar sites by doing a search for "image placeholder"
and you'll find that there are gazillions more of them out thereâ€”like Lorem Picsum and FillMurray.com-->
