			<p>The original sled dogs bred and kept by the Chukchi were thought to have gone extinct,
				but Benedict Allen, writing for Geographical magazine in 2006 after visiting the region, reported their survival.
				His description of the breeding practiced by the Chukchi mentions selection for obedience, endurance, amiable disposition,
				and sizing that enabled families to support them without undue difficulty
				With the help of Siberian Huskies, entire tribes of people were able not only to survive,
				but to push forth into terra incognita <br>
				The Husky usually howls instead of barking.They have been described as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through,
				or even jumping over fences.Because the Siberian Husky had been raised in a family setting by the Chukchi
				and not left to fend for themselves they could be trusted with children.
				The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) classifies the breed as good with children.
				It also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive "without proper care". <br>
				Siberian Huskies have a high prey drive due to the Chukchi allowing them to roam free in the summer.
				The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on wild cats, birds, and squirrels, but with training can be trusted with other small animals.
				They would only return to the Chukchi villages when the snow returned and food became scarce. Their hunting instincts can still be found in the breed today.
